Name your repository what you would like. IF you are doing a project, make sure it relates to it. You can also check the box for a README file if you would like to add a description for your repository. 

## Step 3: Create/Upload A File

You can choose to either create a new file or upload one from your computer. When creating a new file, you will need a name for your file and the you can begin coding.

When commiting your changes, you can add a brief description on what you added or changed from your code.

# Accessing Git
Git is what GitHub uses for their social and user interface. If you have open-source projects that use Git, GitHub is designed to help you better manage them. By using the link, https://git-scm.com/downloads you can download Git.

# Glossary

- **Branch**: A branch is a new or parallel version of the main repository. If you are working on a project that's too big or has an error, a branch of that repository will allow you edit and fix the problem without effecting the main repository. 
- **Clone**: Creates a full copy of your chosen repository from GitHub. This includes all the data, different versions, and folders from the repository.  If you choose to edit on a different editor, you can use Git to track your changes while being able to edit offline.
- **Commit**: A commit is meant to record and save your coding from one or multiple files in your branch. A breif description is usually added describing what was changed.
- **Fetch**: This command (git fetch) allows you to obtain the latest work completed by your other partners. It will be able to download commits, files, and refs from a remote repository into your local repository. Those changes wont't effect your own branches. 
- **GIT**: an open source program mainly used to track changes of in text files. GitHub uses this for their social and user interface.
- **Github**: Cloud-based platform where you can work on coding individually or in groups while also being able to share it with other users. 
- **Merge**: Merge allows the changes from one branch to be applied to another. This is related to when the "pull request" is utalized from GitHub.
- **Merge Conflict**: A problem that arises from merged branches. If the coding was disrupted or changed in some way, it would need to be fixed before the branches can merge.
- **Push**: Sending your commited changes to a remote repository on GitHub. If something is changed locally, it can be pushed so others can see what you changed.
- **Pull**: When you fetch and merge changes. If you have a local copy of your remote file and someone edits it, you would pull those edits or changed made.
- **Remote**: The version of a repository or branch that is being hosted on a server like GitHub. 
- **Repository**: Basically a project's folder. It will store all of the project's files and their revision history.
